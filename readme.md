[**retext**][retext] plugin to implement [SmartyPants][].

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c):
Node 12+ is needed to use it and it must be `import`ed instead of `require`d.

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install retext-smartypants
```

## Use

```js
import {retext} from 'retext'
import retextSmartypants from 'retext-smartypants'

const file = retext()
  .use(retextSmartypants)
  .processSync('He said, "A \'simple\' english sentence. . ."')

console.log(String(file))
```

Yields:

```txt
He said, “A ‘simple’ english sentence…”
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `retextSmartypants`.

### `unified().use(retextSmartypants[, options])`

Replaces dumb/straight/typewriter punctuation marks with smart/curly punctuation
marks.

##### `options`

###### `options.quotes`

Create smart quotes (`boolean`, default: `true`).

Converts straight double and single quotes to smart double or single quotes.

###### `options.openingQuotes`

Which characters to use for opening quotes `{ double: '”', single: '’' }`.

###### `options.closingQuotes`

Which characters to use for closing quotes `{ double: '”', single: '‘' }`.

###### `options.ellipses`

Create smart ellipses (`boolean`, default: `true`).

Converts triple dot characters (with or without spaces between) into a single
Unicode ellipsis character

###### `options.backticks`

Create smart quotes from backticks (`boolean` or `'all'`, default: `true`).

When `true`, converts double back-ticks into an opening double quote, and
double straight single quotes into a closing double quote.

When `'all'`: does the preceding and converts single back-ticks into an
opening single quote, and a straight single quote into a closing single
smart quote.

> **Note**: Quotes can not be `true` when `backticks` is `'all'`;

###### `options.dashes`

Create smart dashes (`boolean` or `'oldschool'`, `'inverted'`, default: `true`).

When `true`, converts two dashes into an em-dash character.

When `'oldschool'`, converts two dashes into an en-dash, and three dashes into
an em-dash.

When `'inverted'`, converts two dashes into an em-dash, and three dashes into
an en-dash.
